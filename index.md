DELL EMC, ATOS and Partners are delighted to be hosting Data-driven systems medicine workshop at the Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre (CUBRIC) on June 11th-12th, 2019, Maindy Road, CF24 4HQ Cardiff. There are places available for Jun 12th only. If you are interested to attend, please contact the Organisers.


The aim of this day and a half long workshop is to gather a multi-disciplinary group of experts from both Academia and IT/Parmaceutical Industry who recognize the applicability of machine learning and computational methods in systems medicine, as a first step on the path to personalised medicine. They will discuss the ways that artificial intelligence and systems modelling can be applied to issues relating to medicine and healthcare using best practice to detail the synergies and interfaces between the different scientific communities and IT industry.


The event will run from 12pm-5pm June 11th to 8.45am-4pm June 12th and will host 15 invited speakers. The workshop is intended for senior PhD students, postdocs, researchers, academics and representatives of Industry with interest/background in the area of data/health science and systems medicine. Up to 15 poster boards are also available. Please contact szomolayb@cardiff.ac.uk with any inquiries.
